## Last Verse
So on his Nightmare through the evening fog  

Flits the squab Fiend o’er fen, and lake, and bog;
Seeks some love-wilder’d maid with sleep oppress’d,  
Alights, and grinning sits upon her breast.  

…expanded version, titled The Loves of Plants…  

—Such as of late amid the murky sky  

Was mark’d by Fuseli’s poetic eye;  
Whose daring tints, with Shakspeare’s happiest grace,  
Gave to the airy phantom form and place.—  
Back o’er her pillow sinks her blushing head,  
Her snow-white limbs hang helpless from the bed;  
Her interrupted heart-pulse swims in death.
